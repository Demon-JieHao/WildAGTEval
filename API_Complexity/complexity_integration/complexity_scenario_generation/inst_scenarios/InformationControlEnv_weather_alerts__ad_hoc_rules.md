# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: Ad Hoc Rules in InformationControlEnv.weather_alerts

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'Ad Hoc Rules' 
would manifest in the API function 'InformationControlEnv.weather_alerts' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## API Function Information

### Description
{'name': 'weather_alerts', 'description': 'Get weather alerts and warnings for a location. Includes severe weather warnings, advisories, and watches.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'location': {'type': 'string', 'description': "(Optional) Location to get weather alerts for. If not provided, uses the user's default location from preferences."}}}, 'error_cases': ['Location not found: Weather data is not available for the specified location.', 'No user preferences: If no location is provided and no user is logged in, defaults to New York.']}

### Implementation
```python
    @staticmethod
    def invoke(data: Dict[str, Any], location: str = None) -> str:
        """
        Get weather alerts for a location.
        
        Args:
            data: The data dictionary containing all information
            location: (Optional) Location to get weather alerts for. If not provided, uses user's default location.
            
        Returns:
            A JSON string with weather alerts
        """
        # Get user preferences
        preferences = get_user_preferences(data)
        
        # Determine location
        if not location:
            location = preferences.get("location", "New York")
        
        # Normalize location for mock data lookup
        location_key = location.lower().replace(" ", "_")
        
        # Get mock weather data
        weather_data = get_mock_data_by_key(data, "weather", location_key)
        
        if not weather_data:
            return json.dumps({
                "success": False,
                "message": f"Weather data not available for location: {location}"
            })
        
        alerts = weather_data.get("alerts", [])
        
        # Add query to history
        user = get_current_user(data)
        if user:
            query = {
                "user_id": user["user_id"],
                "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                "tool": "weather_alerts",
                "parameters": {"location": location},
                "result": "success"
            }
            add_query_to_history(data, query)
        
        return json.dumps({
            "success": True,
            "location": location,
            "alerts": alerts,
            "has_alerts": len(alerts) > 0,
            "alert_count": len(alerts)
        })

```

## Uncertainty Type Information

### Type: Ad Hoc Rules
Special requirements or constraints that, while technically documented, deviate from intuitive expectations.

### Criteria
1. Special Value Semantics Likelihood: The likelihood that the function uses specific numeric or string values that carry special meanings beyond their literal value
2. Non-Standard Format Requirements Likelihood: The likelihood that the function requires data in specific formats that deviate from common industry standards
3. Counter-Intuitive Parameter Behavior Likelihood: The likelihood that parameters behave in ways that contradict what most developers would reasonably expect
4. Hidden Constraints Likelihood: The likelihood that the function has undocumented or obscurely documented restrictions on how it can be used
5. Legacy Compatibility Issues Likelihood: The likelihood that the function contains unusual behaviors primarily to maintain compatibility with older systems

## Plausibility Assessment

### Summary
[From api_assessment_results_0]: Weather alert systems inherently contain numerous ad hoc rules due to their evolution as critical safety infrastructure across different jurisdictions and meteorological services. The function must handle specialized alert codes, varying regional standards, and legacy compatibility requirements while managing complex geographic and temporal constraints. These domain-specific complexities would naturally lead to numerous special cases and non-obvious behaviors that developers would need to learn beyond the basic function description.

[From api_assessment_results_1]: Weather alert systems inherently contain numerous ad hoc rules due to their evolution across different jurisdictions, agencies, and historical systems. The function must handle a complex ecosystem of alert types, priorities, and formats that have developed organically over time rather than through systematic design. These characteristics make it highly likely that developers will encounter special cases, region-specific behaviors, and legacy compatibility requirements that manifest as ad hoc rules.

[From api_assessment_results_2]: Weather alert systems inherently contain numerous ad hoc rules due to their evolution across different jurisdictions, agencies, and historical systems. The function must handle a complex ecosystem of alert types, priorities, and regional variations that have developed organically over time. These characteristics make it highly likely that developers will encounter special values, hidden constraints, and legacy compatibility issues when working with this API in production environments.

### Score
Normalized Score: 0.800 (High)

## Instructions

1. Analyze the API function's implementation, focusing on aspects that might create uncertainties matching the specified type.

2. Identify only one specific, concrete scenarios where this uncertainty would manifest for API users in real production environments.
   - Focus on common usage patterns where developers would naturally encounter this uncertainty
   - Consider the perspectives of developers who use this API function

3. For each scenario:
   - Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the uncertainty
   - Explain how this uncertainty would manifest in practical terms
   - Explain the root cause in the API design
   - Describe the impact on API users and their applications

4. IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on uncertainties intrinsic to the function's conceptual functionalities. 
   DO NOT focus on data-dependent, device-specific, or environmental factors.
   Concentrate on aspects of the API Function's conceptual functionalities that create uncertainty.

5. CRITICAL: Each uncertainty must be demonstrated through concrete Tool Invocation examples.
   Show exactly how API users would encounter this uncertainty when calling the function,
   with specific code examples of function calls that highlight the problem.

6. ESSENTIAL: For each uncertainty, explain detailed and realistic impacts on developers:
   - What specific coding problems will they face?
   - What unexpected behaviors will they need to work around?
   - What additional error handling will they need to implement?
   - How will this affect their development time or code quality?

7. Suggest concrete mitigation approaches:
   - Documentation improvements that would make the uncertainty more manageable

## Special Instructions for Ad Hoc Rules Scenarios

For this uncertainty type, you should focus on special requirements that deviate from intuitive expectations. You may:

1. ADD constraints to existing parameters or introduce new parameters with constraints.
2. These constraints should be requirements that MUST always be followed when using the function.
3. Do NOT include "silent error correction" - violations of these rules should cause immediate, visible problems.
4. Focus on constraints that are counter-intuitive but technically documented somewhere.
5. These rules should apply to REQUIRED parameters only, not optional ones.
6. The rules should be context-independent - they should ALWAYS apply, not just in certain situations.

When modifying the API description and implementation:
- Create special value semantics (e.g., -1 means "last item" and "PT15M" format represents 15 minutes)
- Introduce non-standard format requirements
- Implement counter-intuitive parameter behaviors
- Focus on rules that are always enforced, not situational
