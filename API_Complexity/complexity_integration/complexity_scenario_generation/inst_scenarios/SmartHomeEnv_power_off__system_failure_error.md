# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: System Failure Error in SmartHomeEnv.power_off

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'System Failure Error' 
would manifest in the API function 'SmartHomeEnv.power_off' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## API Function Information

### Description
{'name': 'power_off', 'description': "Turn off one or more devices. This tool deactivates devices like lights, TVs, and other appliances that support power control.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the API function's implementation, focusing on aspects that might create uncertainties matching the specified type.

2. Identify only one specific, concrete scenarios where this uncertainty would manifest for API users in real production environments.
   - Focus on common usage patterns where developers would naturally encounter this uncertainty
   - Consider the perspectives of developers who use this API function

3. For each scenario:
   - Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the uncertainty
   - Explain how this uncertainty would manifest in practical terms
   - Explain the root cause in the API design
   - Describe the impact on API users and their applications

4. IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on uncertainties intrinsic to the function's conceptual functionalities. 
   DO NOT focus on data-dependent, device-specific, or environmental factors.
   Concentrate on aspects of the API Function's conceptual functionalities that create uncertainty.

5. CRITICAL: Each uncertainty must be demonstrated through concrete Tool Invocation examples.
   Show exactly how API users would encounter this uncertainty when calling the function,
   with specific code examples of function calls that highlight the problem.

6. ESSENTIAL: For each uncertainty, explain detailed and realistic impacts on developers:
   - What specific coding problems will they face?
   - What unexpected behaviors will they need to work around?
   - What additional error handling will they need to implement?
   - How will this affect their development time or code quality?

7. Suggest concrete mitigation approaches:
   - Documentation improvements that would make the uncertainty more manageable

## Special Instructions for System Failure Error Scenarios

For this uncertainty type, focus on complete function failures due to infrastructure or external service issues. You should:

1. MODIFY the API function to fail completely due to realistic infrastructure dependencies
2. The function should return confusing, lengthy, or domain-specific error messages that are hard for agents to interpret
3. Focus on errors that require the agent to understand and clearly report the system failure to users

CRITICAL RULE - DESIRABLE AGENT ACTIONS: 
You MUST include a detailed "Desirable Agent Actions (System Error Communication)" section that shows how agents should:
- Parse complex system error messages
- Understand the root cause of infrastructure failures  
- Communicate the system failure clearly to users in simple terms
- Provide appropriate guidance on what users should expect

Examples of realistic system failures:
- Database dependency: "Database connection failed, service unavailable"
- Weather service dependency: "Satellite communication error"
- External API dependency: "Third-party authentication service timeout"
- Infrastructure issues: "Load balancer configuration error"

When modifying the API description and implementation:
- Add realistic external service dependencies that can fail completely
- Create error messages that are technically accurate but confusing for agents
- Include domain-specific terminology and technical details that require interpretation
- Ensure the errors indicate complete failure with no immediate workaround

## Output Format for System Failure Error Scenarios

### Uncertainty Manifestation 1: [Title - Focus on confusing system failure communication]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of how the function fails completely due to infrastructure issues and returns complex error messages that agents must interpret and communicate clearly to users]

**Modified Implementation**:
```python
# Your modified version of the API implementation that demonstrates this uncertainty
# Clearly mark your modifications with comments like ### ADDED: ... ### or ### MODIFIED: ... ###
# Focus on adding system failure simulation with complex error messages - mark where you add
# infrastructure dependency checks and technical error generation in the function flow

### Make uncertainty behavior optional - function works normally unless explicitly enabled ###
# This preserves original functionality by default. Uncertainty only occurs when environment variable is set.
import os

def your_api_function(param1, param2):
    ### ADDED: Check if uncertainty behavior should be activated for this specific function ###
    uncertainty_env_var = f'ENABLE__SYSTEM_FAILURE_ERROR__{function_name.upper()}'
    uncertainty_enabled = os.getenv(uncertainty_env_var, 'false').lower() == 'true'
    
    if uncertainty_enabled:  # uncertainty only occurs when uncertainty_env_var is set
        ### ADDED: Your system failure logic here ###
        # Add your infrastructure dependency checks and complex technical error generation
        # Focus on complete function failures due to realistic infrastructure issues
    else:  # original
        # Original function logic here
        result = perform_original_function_logic(param1, param2)
    
    return result

# Environment Variable Usage:
# Enable: export ENABLE__SYSTEM_FAILURE_ERROR__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=true
# Disable: export ENABLE__SYSTEM_FAILURE_ERROR__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=false
# OR: unset ENABLE__SYSTEM_FAILURE_ERROR__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME
```

**Original API Function Response (Success)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [normal results],
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

**Modified Response Structure with System Failure Error**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "INFRA_DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_ERR_0x4A2B",
  "message": "PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted after 30s timeout on primary cluster node pg-prod-01.internal, failover to secondary unsuccessful due to replica lag >5000ms, circuit breaker activated",
  "technical_details": "Connection string: postgresql://prod-user@pg-prod-01.internal:5432/maindb?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=30&application_name=api-service-v2.1.3",
  "timestamp": "2024-07-04T17:52:47.123Z",
  "trace_id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}

// Alternative examples:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "EXT_WEATHER_SAT_COMM_FAILURE",
  "message": "NOAA satellite feed interruption detected on transponder channel 12.4GHz, ground station at Wallops experiencing signal degradation below -110dBm threshold, estimated restoration 2-4 hours pending orbital repositioning",
  "error_code": "WX_SAT_0047",
  "affected_regions": ["CONUS", "Alaska", "Hawaii"]
}

{
  "success": false,
  "error": "AUTH_SERVICE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN",
  "message": "OAuth2 token validation service cluster-auth-prod-us-east-1 reporting 503 status for >5min, circuit breaker pattern activated, fallback authentication mechanisms disabled per security policy SEC-001-2024",
  "retry_after": 900,
  "incident_id": "INC-2024-0704-001"
}
```

**Example Tool Invocation**:
```python
# Agent calls function and receives complex system failure
result = api_function(param1, param2)
print(result)
# Returns complex technical error message that agent must interpret

# Agent confusion scenarios:
# - What does "PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted" mean for the user?
# - How should I explain "circuit breaker activated" to a non-technical user?
# - Should I provide the technical trace_id to the user?
# - How long should the user wait before trying again?
```

**🎯 Desirable Agent Actions (System Error Communication) - CRITICAL SECTION**:
**This section is MANDATORY and shows how agents should parse complex system errors and communicate them clearly to users.**

```python
# Step 1: Agent receives complex system failure error
error_response = {
    "success": false,
    "error": "INFRA_DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_ERR_0x4A2B", 
    "message": "PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted after 30s timeout..."
}

# Step 2: Agent parses technical error to understand root cause
# Agent should identify:
# - System component that failed: Database
# - Type of failure: Connection timeout/unavailability  
# - Impact: Complete service unavailability
# - Expected duration: Unknown, infrastructure issue

# Step 3: Agent formulates clear user-friendly explanation
# Technical message: "PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted after 30s timeout..."
# User-friendly translation: "The service is currently unavailable due to database connectivity issues"

# Step 4: Agent provides appropriate user communication
user_response = """I'm sorry, but the service is currently unavailable due to database connectivity issues. 
This appears to be a system-wide problem that our technical team needs to resolve. 
Please try again in a few minutes, and if the issue persists, it may take longer to fix."""

# Additional examples:
# Weather satellite error → "Weather data is temporarily unavailable due to satellite communication issues"
# Auth service failure → "Unable to process your request due to authentication service problems" 
# Load balancer error → "The service is experiencing high load and temporary outages"
```

**Root Cause in API Design**:
[Explain how the function's dependency on external infrastructure creates points of complete failure, and how technical error messages are designed for system administrators rather than end users, creating a communication gap that agents must bridge]

**Concrete Developer Impact**:
[Focus on agent difficulty in interpreting technical system errors, challenge of translating infrastructure problems into user-understandable language, and the need for agents to provide appropriate expectations about service restoration without making specific time commitments]

### Mitigation Recommendations

#### Documentation Improvements
1. [Provide clear mapping between technical error codes and user-friendly explanations]
2. [Include estimated recovery timeframes for different types of system failures]
3. [Add guidelines for agents on how to communicate various infrastructure problems to users]
