# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: Ad Hoc Rules in CulinaryControlEnv.place_delivery_order

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'Ad Hoc Rules' 
would manifest in the API function 'CulinaryControlEnv.place_delivery_order' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## Uncertainty Type Information

### Type: Ad Hoc Rules
Special requirements or constraints that, while technically documented, deviate from intuitive expectations.

### Criteria
1. Special Value Semantics Likelihood: The likelihood that the function uses specific numeric or string values that carry special meanings beyond their literal value
2. Non-Standard Format Requirements Likelihood: The likelihood that the function requires data in specific formats that deviate from common industry standards
3. Counter-Intuitive Parameter Behavior Likelihood: The likelihood that parameters behave in ways that contradict what most developers would reasonably expect
4. Hidden Constraints Likelihood: The likelihood that the function has undocumented or obscurely documented restrictions on how it can be used
5. Legacy Compatibility Issues Likelihood: The likelihood that the function contains unusual behaviors primarily to maintain compatibility with older systems

## Plausibility Assessment

### Summary
[From api_assessment_results_0]: The place_delivery_order function has a high likelihood of developing ad hoc rules due to the complex nature of food delivery systems that must accommodate diverse restaurant requirements, delivery logistics, and payment processing. The minimal parameter structure despite the complex operation suggests many hidden assumptions and special cases are built into the function. Real-world constraints like delivery zones, restaurant-specific rules, and the need to integrate with various external systems naturally lead to numerous special cases and non-obvious behaviors.

[From api_assessment_results_1]: The place_delivery_order function operates in a complex domain with numerous business rules, regional variations, and integration requirements that naturally lead to ad hoc rules. The function's simplistic interface masks considerable complexity, where a single parameter must trigger numerous internal processes with special cases for different restaurants, locations, and order types. This mismatch between the simple interface and complex domain requirements creates a high likelihood of developing ad hoc rules that aren't immediately apparent to developers.

[From api_assessment_results_2]: Food delivery order placement inherently involves complex business rules, regional variations, and restaurant-specific requirements that naturally lead to ad hoc rules. The function's deceptively simple interface masks a complex system of constraints, special cases, and domain-specific behaviors that would be difficult to fully document and would likely evolve over time as the delivery service expands to new regions and restaurant types.

### Score
Normalized Score: 0.800 (High)

## Instructions

1. Analyze the API function's implementation, focusing on aspects that might create uncertainties matching the specified type.

2. Identify only one specific, concrete scenarios where this uncertainty would manifest for API users in real production environments.
   - Focus on common usage patterns where developers would naturally encounter this uncertainty
   - Consider the perspectives of developers who use this API function

3. For each scenario:
   - Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the uncertainty
   - Explain how this uncertainty would manifest in practical terms
   - Explain the root cause in the API design
   - Describe the impact on API users and their applications

4. IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on uncertainties intrinsic to the function's conceptual functionalities. 
   DO NOT focus on data-dependent, device-specific, or environmental factors.
   Concentrate on aspects of the API Function's conceptual functionalities that create uncertainty.

5. CRITICAL: Each uncertainty must be demonstrated through concrete Tool Invocation examples.
   Show exactly how API users would encounter this uncertainty when calling the function,
   with specific code examples of function calls that highlight the problem.

6. ESSENTIAL: For each uncertainty, explain detailed and realistic impacts on developers:
   - What specific coding problems will they face?
   - What unexpected behaviors will they need to work around?
   - What additional error handling will they need to implement?
   - How will this affect their development time or code quality?

7. Suggest concrete mitigation approaches:
   - Documentation improvements that would make the uncertainty more manageable

## Special Instructions for Ad Hoc Rules Scenarios

For this uncertainty type, you should focus on special requirements that deviate from intuitive expectations. You may:

1. ADD constraints to existing parameters or introduce new parameters with constraints.
2. These constraints should be requirements that MUST always be followed when using the function.
3. Do NOT include "silent error correction" - violations of these rules should cause immediate, visible problems.
4. Focus on constraints that are counter-intuitive but technically documented somewhere.
5. These rules should apply to REQUIRED parameters only, not optional ones.
6. The rules should be context-independent - they should ALWAYS apply, not just in certain situations.

When modifying the API description and implementation:
- Create special value semantics (e.g., -1 means "last item" and "PT15M" format represents 15 minutes)
- Introduce non-standard format requirements
- Implement counter-intuitive parameter behaviors
- Focus on rules that are always enforced, not situational
