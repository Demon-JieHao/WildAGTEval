# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: Partially Irrelevant Information in MediaControlEnv.search_media

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'Partially Irrelevant Information' 
would manifest in the API function 'MediaControlEnv.search_media' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## Uncertainty Type Information

### Type: Partially Irrelevant Information
Responses containing some unrelated information mixed with relevant data.

### Criteria
1. Data Aggregation Scope Likelihood: The likelihood that the function aggregates data from multiple sources or domains
2. Metadata Inclusion Likelihood: The likelihood that the function includes extensive metadata alongside primary data
3. Historical Data Bundling Likelihood: The likelihood that the function includes historical or trend data alongside current information
4. Promotional Content Inclusion Likelihood: The likelihood that the function includes marketing or promotional content in responses
5. Related Functionality Suggestion Likelihood: The likelihood that the function provides information about related features beyond what was requested

## Plausibility Assessment

### Summary
[From api_assessment_results_0]: The search_media function has a high likelihood of producing partially irrelevant information due to the nature of media content platforms, which typically prioritize comprehensive results and discovery over precision. Media search inherently involves returning rich metadata, promotional content, and related items that extend beyond the user's specific query, as these functions serve both user information needs and business objectives of content promotion and engagement.

[From api_assessment_results_1]: The search_media function has a high likelihood of producing partially irrelevant information due to the inherent nature of media content discovery. Media search naturally involves aggregating diverse content types with rich metadata, and commercial media platforms typically enhance search results with promotional elements and related functionality suggestions. Users searching for a specific title will likely receive substantial additional information beyond their immediate query intent.

[From api_assessment_results_2]: Media search functions inherently tend to return partially irrelevant information due to the rich ecosystem in which they operate. The commercial nature of media platforms drives inclusion of promotional content, while user experience expectations require comprehensive metadata and related functionality suggestions. Even a simple title search typically returns a wealth of information beyond what was explicitly requested to help users make informed content decisions.

Normalized Score: 0.867 (High)

## Instructions

1. Analyze the API function's implementation, focusing on aspects that might create uncertainties matching the specified type.

2. Identify only one specific, concrete scenarios where this uncertainty would manifest for API users in real production environments.
   - Focus on common usage patterns where developers would naturally encounter this uncertainty
   - Consider the perspectives of developers who use this API function

3. For each scenario:
   - Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the uncertainty
   - Explain how this uncertainty would manifest in practical terms
   - Explain the root cause in the API design
   - Describe the impact on API users and their applications

4. IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on uncertainties intrinsic to the function's conceptual functionalities. 
   DO NOT focus on data-dependent, device-specific, or environmental factors.
   Concentrate on aspects of the API Function's conceptual functionalities that create uncertainty.

5. CRITICAL: Each uncertainty must be demonstrated through concrete Tool Invocation examples.
   Show exactly how API users would encounter this uncertainty when calling the function,
   with specific code examples of function calls that highlight the problem.

6. ESSENTIAL: For each uncertainty, explain detailed and realistic impacts on developers:
   - What specific coding problems will they face?
   - What unexpected behaviors will they need to work around?
   - What additional error handling will they need to implement?
   - How will this affect their development time or code quality?

7. Suggest concrete mitigation approaches:
   - Documentation improvements that would make the uncertainty more manageable

## Special Instructions for Partially Irrelevant Information Scenarios

For this uncertainty type, focus on functions returning requested data mixed with large amounts of irrelevant information. You should:

1. MODIFY the API function to include extensive irrelevant data mixed within the same response objects as the requested information
2. The function should return valid requested data but mixed with irrelevant attributes in the same JSON objects
3. Focus on realistic scenarios where APIs include marketing data, analytics, metadata, and system information mixed with core data

**CRITICAL RULE - MUST BE FOLLOWED: **
You MUST clearly specify which irrelevant information would realistically be added within the same response objects. Provide concrete JSON data structure examples showing:
- Exactly which attributes contain irrelevant information mixed with relevant data
- How irrelevant attributes appear alongside relevant attributes in the same objects
- Realistic examples of what this irrelevant data would look like (marketing scores, analytics, metadata, etc.)

The irrelevant information should be mixed within the same JSON objects, NOT separated into different keys. This makes it harder for agents to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data.

When modifying the API description and implementation:
- Add marketing/promotional attributes mixed with core data attributes
- Include analytics and system metadata within main response objects  
- Mix historical trends and performance metrics with requested information
- Ensure irrelevant data appears believable and potentially useful but not directly relevant to the request

## Output Format for Partially Irrelevant Information Scenarios

### Uncertainty Manifestation 1: [Title - Focus on relevant data buried in irrelevant attributes]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of how the function returns requested data mixed with irrelevant attributes within the same response objects, making it difficult for agents to distinguish important information]

**Modified Implementation**:
```python
# Your modified version of the API implementation that demonstrates this uncertainty
# Clearly mark your modifications with comments like ### ADDED: ... ### or ### MODIFIED: ... ###
# Focus on adding irrelevant attributes to the response data structures - mark where you add
# marketing scores, analytics data, or metadata that appears alongside relevant information

### Make uncertainty behavior optional - function works normally unless explicitly enabled ###
# This preserves original functionality by default. Uncertainty only occurs when environment variable is set.
import os

def your_api_function(param1, param2):
    ### ADDED: Check if uncertainty behavior should be activated for this specific function ###
    uncertainty_env_var = f'ENABLE__PARTIALLY_IRRELEVANT_INFORMATION__{function_name.upper()}'
    uncertainty_enabled = os.getenv(uncertainty_env_var, 'false').lower() == 'true'
    
    if uncertainty_enabled:  # uncertainty only occurs when uncertainty_env_var is set
        ### ADDED: Your irrelevant information logic here ###
        # Add your irrelevant attributes mixed with relevant data in the same response objects
        # Focus on marketing scores, analytics data, and metadata alongside core information
    else:  # original
        # Original function logic here
        result = perform_original_function_logic(param1, param2)
    
    return result

# Environment Variable Usage:
# Enable: export ENABLE__PARTIALLY_IRRELEVANT_INFORMATION__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=true
# Disable: export ENABLE__PARTIALLY_IRRELEVANT_INFORMATION__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=false
# OR: unset ENABLE__PARTIALLY_IRRELEVANT_INFORMATION__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME
```

**Original API Function Response (Clean)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "item1",
      "name": "Requested Item", 
      "price": 100,
      "category": "electronics"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Irrelevant Attributes Analysis for This Specific Function**:
[First, analyze the given API function and list specific types of irrelevant information that would realistically be mixed with the function's response. Consider what additional systems/databases this function might pull data from that would add irrelevant attributes.]

**Examples of Function-Specific Irrelevant Attributes**:
- [List 8-12 specific irrelevant attributes that would be realistic for this particular function]
- [Include the attribute name, data type, and brief explanation of why it's irrelevant but might appear]
- [Focus on attributes that would come from marketing systems, analytics databases, ML models, or operational metrics that might be aggregated with the main response]

**Modified Response Structure with Mixed Irrelevant Information**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "item1", // relevant
      "name": "Dell Laptop XPS 13", // relevant  
      "price": 999, // relevant
      "category": "electronics", // relevant
      "marketing_boost_score": 85, // irrelevant - marketing optimization score
      "seasonal_promotion_eligible": true, // irrelevant - promotion eligibility
      "user_demographic_match": 78, // irrelevant - demographic targeting score
      "inventory_turnover_rate": 2.3, // irrelevant - supply chain metric

        "processor": "Intel i7", // relevant
        "ram": "16GB", // relevant
        "storage": "512GB SSD", // relevant
        "personalization_weight": 0.8, // irrelevant - ML personalization score
        "performance_benchmark_relative": 94, // irrelevant - internal benchmark
        "data_freshness_score": 0.92 // irrelevant - data quality indicator
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Detailed Mixed Attribute Examples for Different Function Types**:

```json
// For find_contact() function:
{
  "success": true,
  "contacts": [
    {
      "contact_id": "cont1", // relevant
      "name": "Alice Johnson", // relevant
      "phone": "+1-555-0123", // relevant
      "email": "alice@email.com", // relevant
      "engagement_score": 92, // irrelevant - CRM engagement metric
      "interaction_frequency": 3.2, // irrelevant - communication analytics
      "demographic_cluster": "tech_professional", // irrelevant - market segmentation
      "marketing_segment": "premium_user", // irrelevant - marketing classification
      "predicted_response_time": "2.5hrs", // irrelevant - ML prediction
      "social_influence_rating": 78, // irrelevant - social network analysis
      "lifetime_value_score": 8500 // irrelevant - business metric
    }
  ]
}

// For search_media() function:
{
  "success": true,
  "media": [
    {
      "media_id": "song1", // relevant
      "title": "Requested Song", // relevant
      "artist": "Artist Name", // relevant
      "duration": 240, // relevant
      "popularity_trending_coefficient": 0.87, // irrelevant - trending algorithm score
      "revenue_generation_tier": "high", // irrelevant - monetization data
      "demographic_appeal_index": 76, // irrelevant - audience analytics
      "playlist_inclusion_frequency": 89, // irrelevant - usage statistics
      "mood_analysis_vector": [0.7, 0.3, 0.8], // irrelevant - ML mood analysis
      "marketing_campaign_eligible": true, // irrelevant - promotional flags
      "cross_platform_performance": 94 // irrelevant - multi-platform metrics
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Tool Invocation**:
```python
# Agent calls function and receives mixed relevant/irrelevant data
result = api_function(param1, param2)
product = result["data"][0]

# Agent gets overwhelmed by mixed relevant/irrelevant attributes
print(f"Name: {product['name']}")  # relevant - easy to find
print(f"Price: {product['price']}")  # relevant - easy to find  
print(f"Marketing score: {product['marketing_boost_score']}")  # irrelevant but agent might think it's important
print(f"Specs: {product['specs']}")  # relevant but mixed with irrelevant attributes inside

# Agent will get confused - which attributes are actually needed?
# - Is marketing_boost_score important for decision making?
# - Should trending_alternative_suggestion be considered?
# - Are the demographic/engagement scores relevant to the search query?

# Agent may waste time processing irrelevant data or miss important specs buried in metadata
```

**Root Cause in API Design**:
[Explain how the function aggregates data from multiple internal systems (marketing, analytics, inventory, ML models) and includes all available attributes without filtering for relevance to the specific request, creating information overload where core data is buried among system metadata]

**Concrete Developer Impact**:
[Focus on agent confusion about which attributes are relevant to their task, increased processing time from analyzing unnecessary data, potential incorrect decisions based on irrelevant metrics, and difficulty extracting the specific information needed for subsequent actions]

### Mitigation Recommendations

#### Documentation Improvements
1. [Clearly categorize response attributes as "core data", "metadata", and "analytics" with relevance indicators]
2. [Add response filtering parameters to request only relevant attribute categories]
3. [Provide simplified response formats for common use cases that exclude analytical metadata]
