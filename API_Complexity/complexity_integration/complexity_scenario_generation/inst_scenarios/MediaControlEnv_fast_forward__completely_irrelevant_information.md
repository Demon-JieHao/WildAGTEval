# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: Completely Irrelevant Information in MediaControlEnv.fast_forward

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'Completely Irrelevant Information' 
would manifest in the API function 'MediaControlEnv.fast_forward' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## Uncertainty Type Information

### Type: Completely Irrelevant Information
Responses with no useful information for the task.

### Criteria
1. Default Response Fallback Likelihood: The likelihood that the function returns default or placeholder data when unable to process the request properly
2. Outdated Cache Return Likelihood: The likelihood that the function returns cached data regardless of its relevance to the current query
3. Request Misinterpretation Likelihood: The likelihood that the function fundamentally misinterprets the request parameters
4. Error Suppression Likelihood: The likelihood that the function hides errors by returning nominal but irrelevant responses

## Plausibility Assessment

### Summary
[From api_assessment_results_0]: The fast_forward function has a moderate likelihood of producing completely irrelevant information primarily due to its tendency to mask errors and prioritize playback continuity over accuracy. Media control functions typically favor maintaining the user experience over strict adherence to requested parameters, potentially leading to situations where the reported state doesn't match reality. The dynamic nature of media playback also introduces challenges in ensuring that returned information accurately reflects the current state after operations.

[From api_assessment_results_1]: The fast_forward function operates in a domain where user experience continuity is prioritized over technical accuracy, making it prone to returning irrelevant information when operations cannot be performed exactly as requested. Media playback functions typically mask partial failures to maintain seamless user experience, and the parameter mismatch in this function increases the likelihood of request misinterpretation, potentially leading to responses that don't accurately reflect what happened during execution.

[From api_assessment_results_2]: The fast_forward function has a moderate likelihood of producing completely irrelevant information primarily due to parameter ambiguity and the dynamic nature of media playback. The mismatch between the function's description (fast-forwarding by seconds) and its parameters (endpoints array) creates inherent confusion that could lead to misinterpreted requests. Additionally, the real-time nature of media playback creates scenarios where maintaining user experience might be prioritized over providing completely accurate information about the operation's results.
