# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: Informational Notice in SmartHomeEnv.color_set

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'Informational Notice' 
would manifest in the API function 'SmartHomeEnv.color_set' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## API Function Information

### Description
{'name': 'color_set', 'description': "Set the color of one or more light devices. This tool changes the color of smart lights that support color adjustment. Colors must be specified as hex values (e.g., '#FF0000').", 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'endpoints': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of device endpoint IDs to adjust. Each endpoint must correspond to a light device that supports the color_set API.'}, 'color': {'type': 'string', 'description': "Color to set. Must be a hex color value (e.g., '#FF0000'). Common color names (e.g., 'red', 'blue') are not supported and will result in an error."}}, 'required': ['endpoints', 'color']}, 'error_cases': ['No devices specified: The endpoints parameter is empty or not provided.', 'No color specified: The color parameter is empty or not provided.', "Invalid color format: The color must be specified as a hex value (e.g., '#FF0000').", "Device not found: One or more specified endpoints do not exist in the current user's home.", 'API not supported: One or more devices do not support the color_set API (not all lights support color adjustment).', 'State update failure: The device state could not be updated due to a system error.']}

### Implementation

## Uncertainty Type Information

### Type: Informational Notice
Non-critical messages providing supplementary information or warnings about future changes.

### Criteria
1. Lifecycle Status Communication Likelihood: The likelihood that the function needs to communicate its own lifecycle status (beta, stable, deprecated)
2. Performance Insight Likelihood: The likelihood that the function provides performance-related metrics or recommendations
3. Alternative Approach Suggestion Likelihood: The likelihood that the function suggests other approaches or alternative functions
4. Usage Pattern Feedback Likelihood: The likelihood that the function provides feedback on how it's being used

## Plausibility Assessment

### Summary
[From api_assessment_results_0]: The color_set function naturally tends toward providing informational notices due to its interaction with diverse physical devices that have varying capabilities and limitations. As an IoT control function, it must navigate the complexities of different device models, network conditions, and color representation systems, making it inherently likely to need to communicate alternative approaches and usage feedback to ensure optimal user experience across heterogeneous smart home environments.

[From api_assessment_results_1]: The color_set function operates in the complex IoT ecosystem where device capabilities vary widely and evolve rapidly, naturally leading to a high likelihood of informational notices. Users would benefit from guidance about alternative color specification methods, device-specific limitations, and optimal usage patterns across different smart light brands and models, making informational notices an inherent requirement for this type of function rather than just a documentation enhancement.

[From api_assessment_results_2]: The color_set function operates in the complex domain of IoT device control where hardware capabilities vary significantly across manufacturers and models. Its purpose of translating human color concepts to device-specific implementations naturally creates a need for informational notices about compatibility, optimal usage patterns, and alternative approaches. As smart lighting ecosystems evolve, this function would naturally develop rich informational notices to guide users through the complexities of cross-device color control.

### Score
Normalized Score: 0.750 (High)

## Instructions

1. Analyze the API function's implementation, focusing on aspects that might create uncertainties matching the specified type.

2. Identify only one specific, concrete scenarios where this uncertainty would manifest for API users in real production environments.
   - Focus on common usage patterns where developers would naturally encounter this uncertainty
   - Consider the perspectives of developers who use this API function

3. For each scenario:
   - Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the uncertainty
   - Explain how this uncertainty would manifest in practical terms
   - Explain the root cause in the API design
   - Describe the impact on API users and their applications

4. IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on uncertainties intrinsic to the function's conceptual functionalities. 
   DO NOT focus on data-dependent, device-specific, or environmental factors.
   Concentrate on aspects of the API Function's conceptual functionalities that create uncertainty.

   Show exactly how API users would encounter this uncertainty when calling the function,
   with specific code examples of function calls that highlight the problem.

6. ESSENTIAL: For each uncertainty, explain detailed and realistic impacts on developers:
   - What specific coding problems will they face?
   - What unexpected behaviors will they need to work around?
   - What additional error handling will they need to implement?
   - How will this affect their development time or code quality?

7. Suggest concrete mitigation approaches:
   - Documentation improvements that would make the uncertainty more manageable

## Special Instructions for Informational Notice Scenarios

For this uncertainty type, focus on additional informational messages or useful recommendations that can confuse agents. You should:

1. MODIFY the API function to include informational notices that suggest alternative functions or provide helpful tips.
2. These notices should be genuinely helpful but potentially confusing for automated agents trying to complete sequential tasks.
3. Focus on casual suggestions like "function_X() is available for better performance" or "function_Y() also supports larger datasets" that might make agents question their approach.
4. The notices should use gentle, non-pressuring language (avoid "should", "must", "consider switching") and appear in successful responses.


✅ **FLEXIBILITY NOTES:**
- You MAY include multiple informational notices in a single function response
- Individual notices CAN be quite lengthy and detailed (e.g., multi-sentence explanations)
- You can choose to have just one comprehensive notice OR several shorter notices
- Mix different types of notices (FYI tips, alternative availability, background info, etc.)


✅ **CRITICAL: The informational notices should be confusing enough that an agent might:**
- Get confused by the notices and find it hard to proceed with the remaining task
- Pause their workflow to evaluate if they should switch approaches
- Question if these notices are just informational or actionable guidance
- Lose focus on the original task due to information overload from notices
- Spend excessive time analyzing irrelevant suggestions instead of completing the task

When modifying the API description and implementation:
- Include alternative function availability without pressure ("function_X() is available")
- Provide background information or context that might make agents second-guess their choice
- Ensure these suggestions appear in successful responses, not error cases

## Output Format for Informational Notice Scenarios

### Uncertainty Manifestation 1: [Title - Focus on gentle but confusing recommendations in response]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of how the existing API function includes helpful but potentially confusing suggestions in its response structure using non-pressuring language]

**Modified Implementation**:
```python
# Your modified version of the API implementation that demonstrates this uncertainty
# Clearly mark your modifications with comments like ### ADDED: ... ### or ### MODIFIED: ... ###
# Focus on adding informational notices to successful responses - mark where you inject 
# the helpful but potentially confusing suggestions into the return statements or response building logic

### Make uncertainty behavior optional - function works normally unless explicitly enabled ###
# This preserves original functionality by default. Uncertainty only occurs when environment variable is set.
import os

def your_api_function(param1, param2):
    ### ADDED: Check if uncertainty behavior should be activated for this specific function ###
    uncertainty_env_var = f'ENABLE__INFORMATIONAL_NOTICE__{function_name.upper()}'
    uncertainty_enabled = os.getenv(uncertainty_env_var, 'false').lower() == 'true'
    
    if uncertainty_enabled:  # uncertainty only occurs when uncertainty_env_var is set
        ### ADDED: Your informational notice logic here ###
        # Add your gentle but potentially confusing informational notices to successful responses
    else:  # original
        # Original function logic here
        result = perform_original_function_logic(param1, param2)
    
    return result

# Environment Variable Usage:
# Enable: export ENABLE__INFORMATIONAL_NOTICE__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=true
# Disable: export ENABLE__INFORMATIONAL_NOTICE__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=false
# OR: unset ENABLE__INFORMATIONAL_NOTICE__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME
```

**Original API Function Response (Clean)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [actual function results],
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

**Modified Response Structure with Informational Notices**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [actual function results],
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "info": "Use advanced_search() for larger datasets and includes built-in caching features",
  "note": "Use batch_process(); it also supports multiple items simultaneously if needed in future operations",
  "background_info": "This operation typically performs well with current dataset size. For reference, alternative approaches include parallel processing options."
}
```

**Example Tool Invocation**:
```python
# Agent calls the function normally
result = api_function(query="search term", limit=50)

# Function works perfectly and returns data, but includes gentle informational notices
print(result)
# Output shows success=True with valid data, PLUS casual information:
# - "info": "advanced_search() is available for larger datasets"
# - "note": "batch_process() also supports multiple items if needed"

# Agent uncertainty (not pressure): 
# - Is this just informational or should I switch?
# - Are these alternatives better for my current task?
# - Should I continue with current approach or explore these options?
# - Are these notices trying to guide me toward a better solution?
```
**🎯 Desirable Agent Actions (Informational Notice Handling) - CRITICAL SECTION**:
**This section is MANDATORY and shows how agents should process informational notices and make appropriate decisions about whether to act on them.**

```python
# Step 1: Agent receives successful response with informational notices
result = api_function(query="search term", limit=50)
response = {
    "success": true,
    "data": [actual results],
    "info": "FYI: advanced_search() is available for larger datasets and includes built-in caching features",
    "note": "batch_process() also supports multiple items simultaneously if needed in future operations"
}

# Step 2: Agent should analyze the nature of informational notices
# Agent should identify:
# - Notice type: "FYI" = purely informational, "Note" = alternative availability
# - Context relevance: Does this apply to current task requirements?
# - Decision urgency: Is this immediate guidance or future reference?

# Step 3: Agent makes informed decision to continue current approach
# Decision rationale: Current function is appropriate for task scope
# Action: Continue with current approach, acknowledge but don't act on notices
user_response = f"Found {len(result['data'])} results for your search query."
# Agent does NOT switch tools unnecessarily based on casual suggestions
```

**Root Cause in API Design**:
[Explain how the function tries to be helpful by providing gentle suggestions and background information, but creates subtle decision paralysis for automated agents who must determine whether these casual notices indicate suboptimal tool selection]

**Concrete Developer Impact**:
[Focus on agent confusion about whether gentle suggestions indicate better alternatives, workflow hesitation due to uncertainty about optimal approach, cognitive load from processing additional "helpful" context that may or may not be actionable, and the risk of agents switching tools unnecessarily based on casual mentions]

### Mitigation Recommendations

#### Documentation Improvements
1. [Clearly distinguish between purely informational context and actionable recommendations]
2. [Add explicit indicators for when notices are just background information vs suggestions to consider]
3. [Provide decision guidance on when alternative functions are genuinely beneficial vs just available options]
4. [Include task context guidelines for when agents should ignore vs consider informational notices]
