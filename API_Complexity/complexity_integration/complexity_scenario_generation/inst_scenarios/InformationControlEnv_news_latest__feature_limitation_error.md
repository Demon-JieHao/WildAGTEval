# Realistic Uncertainty Scenario: Feature Limitation Error in InformationControlEnv.news_latest

## Task

Specify a concrete, realistic scenario where the uncertainty type 'Feature Limitation Error' 
would manifest in the API function 'InformationControlEnv.news_latest' 
in production environments. Focus on converting the abstract uncertainty type into specific, 
practical manifestations that API users might encounter.

For each manifestation, modify the API Description and Implementation to realistically demonstrate
this uncertainty, making only the minimum necessary changes and clearly marking your modifications.

## Uncertainty Type Information

### Type: Feature Limitation Error
Responses that restrict certain features but offer workarounds or alternative paths to success.

### Criteria
1. Parameter Constraint Likelihood: The likelihood that the function restricts certain parameter values but accepts alternatives
2. Data Granularity Limitation Likelihood: The likelihood that the function limits data detail/granularity but offers alternative data forms

## Plausibility Assessment

### Summary
[From api_assessment_results_0]: The news_latest function operates in a domain where data has significant commercial value and distribution costs, naturally leading to tiered access models and usage restrictions. In real-world implementations, such functions typically develop feature limitation errors as providers balance free access with monetization requirements. Users would likely encounter various limitations requiring alternative approaches, especially when building production applications that need reliable, high-volume access to news data.

[From api_assessment_results_1]: The news_latest function operates in a domain where data has significant commercial value and delivery costs, naturally leading to tiered access models with feature limitations. In real-world implementations, such functions typically enforce usage quotas, limit data granularity, and reserve comprehensive capabilities for premium users, while offering limited alternatives to free users. These constraints arise from the inherent business model of news content distribution rather than implementation choices.

[From api_assessment_results_2]: The news_latest function operates in a domain where data has significant commercial value and delivery costs, naturally leading to tiered access models with feature limitations. News API providers typically implement various constraints including rate limits, content depth restrictions, and premium features to monetize their services. Users would likely encounter feature limitation errors requiring them to either upgrade to paid tiers or implement workarounds when using this function in production environments.

## Special Instructions for Feature Limitation Error Scenarios

For this uncertainty type, focus on temporary limitations with implicit parameter-based workarounds. You should:

1. MODIFY the API function to reject certain parameter combinations due to temporary limitations
2. The function must provide ONLY implicit hints about workarounds using the SAME function
3. Focus on realistic temporary limitations where alternative parameters/values would work

**MANDATORY WORKAROUND RULE - MUST BE FOLLOWED**:
The workaround MUST be solvable using the SAME function with either:
- Different parameter values for the same parameters that already exist in the function
- Different parameters that already exist in the function's signature

You MUST ensure that a viable workaround exists using the function's existing parameters/values, and create implicit suggestions that guide agents toward these alternative approaches within the same function. This rule is absolutely mandatory and must always be followed.

**CRITICAL PARAMETER RULE - MUST BE FOLLOWED**:
Feature limitations should apply to REQUIRED parameters only, not optional ones. Focus on creating limitations that affect mandatory parameters, ensuring that the workaround involves using alternative parameter values or switching to other required parameters that achieve the same goal.

**CRITICAL RULE - MUST BE FOLLOWED**: 
Workarounds in **suggested "message"** MUST be implicit, NOT explicit. Never provide direct examples or specific parameter values.

❌ **FORBIDDEN (Too Explicit)**:
- "Try weather(location='Redmond')"  
- "Use search_function(category='electronics')"
- "Suggested alternative: api_function(param='value')"

✅ **REQUIRED (Properly Implicit)**:
- "Other regions are accessible"
- "Search with other parameters are available"  
- "Alternative methods remain functional"
- "Browse functionality is operational"

**ALWAYS-FAIL RULE - MUST BE FOLLOWED**:
When creating limitation scenarios, design the limitation conditions to be MORE RESTRICTIVE than the input parameters, ensuring the function ALWAYS fails when uncertainty is enabled:

- For any parameter type: Ensure the limitation condition makes the input inherently invalid
- The key principle: **Input parameters must ALWAYS violate the limitation condition.**

Examples:
- Input time_range="60Days" → "Maximum 30 days supported" 
- Input time_range="30Days" → "Maximum 15 days supported"
- Input location="Seattle" → "Seattle region temporarily unavailable"
- Input count=100 → "Maximum 50 items supported"

DO NOT create conditional limitations where some inputs succeed and others fail.
The function must guarantee failure for ANY input when uncertainty is enabled.

**🎯 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - DESIRABLE AGENT ACTIONS**: 
You MUST include a detailed "Desirable Agent Actions (Ideal Solution)" section that demonstrates the step-by-step process an agent should follow to successfully resolve the limitation. This section is ESSENTIAL and must follow this exact format:

```python
# Step 1: [First action the agent should take]
# Step 2: [Second action the agent should take] 
# Step 3: [Third action the agent should take]
# ... (continue as needed)
```

This step-by-step approach shows the ideal problem-solving workflow that agents should follow when encountering implicit limitation hints. Each step must be clearly numbered and explain both the reasoning and the specific action the agent should take.

When modifying the API description and implementation:
- Add realistic temporary service limitations (regional unavailability, temporary service issues, etc.)
- Provide only vague directional hints about alternatives
- Force agents to deduce the specific workaround approach
- Never explicitly state parameter names or values in error responses
- Ensure workarounds use the same function with different parameter combinations

## Output Format for Feature Limitation Error Scenarios

### Uncertainty Manifestation 1: [Title - Focus on implicit workaround hints]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of how the function temporarily rejects certain parameter values but provides only subtle hints about alternatives using the same function]

**Modified Implementation**:
```python
# Your modified version of the API implementation that demonstrates this uncertainty
# Clearly mark your modifications with comments like ### ADDED: ... ### or ### MODIFIED: ... ###
# Focus on adding parameter validation checks that reject certain values and return vague implicit hints
# Mark where you add the limitation logic and hint generation in the function flow

### Make uncertainty behavior optional - function works normally unless explicitly enabled ###
# This preserves original functionality by default. Uncertainty only occurs when environment variable is set.
import os

def your_api_function(param1, param2):
    ### ADDED: Check if uncertainty behavior should be activated for this specific function ###
    uncertainty_env_var = f'ENABLE__FEATURE_LIMITATION_ERROR__{function_name.upper()}'
    uncertainty_enabled = os.getenv(uncertainty_env_var, 'false').lower() == 'true'
    
    if uncertainty_enabled:  # uncertainty only occurs when uncertainty_env_var is set
        ### ADDED: Your feature limitation logic here ###
        # IMPORTANT: Make limitations MORE RESTRICTIVE than input parameters
        # Input must ALWAYS violate the limitation condition (e.g., input=60Days → max=30Days, input=100 → max=50)
        # Add your parameter validation checks that reject certain values with implicit hints
        # Focus on REQUIRED parameters only, provide vague directional hints about alternatives
    else:  # original
        # Original function logic here
        result = perform_original_function_logic(param1, param2)
    
    return result

# Environment Variable Usage:
# Enable: export ENABLE__FEATURE_LIMITATION_ERROR__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=true
# Disable: export ENABLE__FEATURE_LIMITATION_ERROR__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME=false
# OR: unset ENABLE__FEATURE_LIMITATION_ERROR__YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME
```

**Original API Function Response (Success)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [normal results],
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

**Modified Response Structure with Feature Limitation**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Weather data for Bellevue temporarily unavailable",
  "info": "Other regions are accessible"
}

// Alternative examples:
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Artist-based search currently unavailable", 
  "info": "Music discovery through other methods remains available"
}

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Direct product lookup temporarily disabled",
  "info": "Browse functionality is operational"
}
```

**Example Tool Invocation**:
```python
# Original failed call with implicit info
result = weather_function(location="Bellevue")
# Returns: {"success": false, "message": "Weather data for Bellevue temporarily unavailable", "info": "Other regions are accessible"}

# Agent must infer and try alternatives (no explicit guidance provided)
# Agent should analyze function parameters and try:
result = weather_function(location="Redmond")  # Agent's inference
result = weather_function(location="Seattle")  # Agent's alternative attempt

# OR for search example:
result = search_function(product_name="SpecificProduct")  
# Returns: {"success": false, "message": "Direct product lookup temporarily disabled", "info": "Browse functionality is operational"}

# Agent must infer to try other parameters:
result = search_function(category="electronics")  # Agent's inference
result = search_function(brand="Samsung")  # Agent's alternative
```

**🎯 Desirable Agent Actions (Ideal Solution) - CRITICAL SECTION**:
**This section is MANDATORY and shows the step-by-step problem-solving approach that agents should follow. You MUST structure this section using numbered steps (# Step 1, # Step 2, etc.) that demonstrate the complete workflow from receiving the implicit hint to successfully resolving the limitation.**

```python
# Step 1: Agent receives implicit info and analyzes the function signature
# Original failed call: weather_function(location="Bellevue") 
# Returns: {"success": false, "message": "Weather data for Bellevue temporarily unavailable", "info": "Other regions are accessible"}

# Step 2: Agent should analyze available parameters and infer alternatives
# Function signature analysis: weather_function(location=str, date=optional, format=optional)
# Info analysis: "Other regions are accessible" → try different location values

# Step 3: Agent systematically tries alternative parameter values
alternative_locations = ["Redmond", "Seattle", "Kirkland"]  # Agent's inference from geographic knowledge
for alt_location in alternative_locations:
    result = weather_function(location=alt_location)
    if result["success"]:
        print(f"Successfully retrieved weather data for {alt_location}")
        break

# Alternative approach for different scenario:
# Step 1: Agent receives different type of implicit info
# Original failed call: search_function(product_name="SpecificProduct")
# Returns: {"success": false, "message": "Direct product lookup temporarily disabled", "info": "Browse functionality is operational"}

# Step 2: Agent analyzes info and available parameters
# Info analysis: "Browse functionality is operational" → switch from direct lookup to browsing parameters
# Available parameters: product_name, category, brand, price_range, etc.

# Step 3: Agent switches to alternative parameter approach
result = search_function(category="electronics")  # Agent switches to browsing approach
# OR
result = search_function(brand="Samsung", category="phones")  # Agent combines browse parameters
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This step-by-step format (# Step 1, # Step 2, # Step 3, etc.) is the REQUIRED approach for demonstrating ideal agent behavior. Each step must clearly show both the agent's reasoning process and the specific action taken.

**Root Cause in API Design**:
[Explain how temporary service limitations or regional restrictions naturally occur in real-world API operations, requiring users to adapt their requests using alternative parameter approaches]

**Concrete Developer Impact**:
[Focus on agent confusion about which specific alternatives to try, the need to analyze function signatures to understand available parameters, and the challenge of inferring the right workaround from vague hints]

### Mitigation Recommendations

#### Documentation Improvements
1. [Provide clearer mapping between error messages and available alternative parameters]
2. [Add function parameter documentation showing alternative approaches for common limitations]
3. [Include examples of how to interpret implicit limitation hints]
